# content-management-system

## This program combines PHP and MySQL to deliver a data-driven website to split public and private content.

The general public can view what subjects and pages are visible, coupled with an option to log in as an admin (placement of which is to be modified for a better UI).

This is a secure login form, and as such, users with admin status will be able to edit content that appears to the general public, as well as preview content before setting the visibility for public context.

Admins will be able to create new subjects/pages, modify and delete them, as well as adding new admins.

All the information is stored on a user-generated database, access of which is due to be updated for general use, and is dynamically called using the MySQLi API.

The various create and edit forms are all validated, with accompanying automated functionality in effort to optimise UX.

Support and feedback is always more than welcome, and all bug fixes ae scheduled to be completed within the coming weeks.
